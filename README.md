## Description

This project would have you reverse engineer a game that is text based. 
1. http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/

The above is an example.
## Context

This is important because creating this game would allow you to focus mainly on an interactive language and how it interacts with the elements on the page, which change over time. You would learn how the functionality of certain parts of the code depend on each other. 
## Specifications
- [ ] As a user, I can save the game.
- [ ] As a user, I can "buy" items that increase the counter rate.
- [ ] As a user, I can see the amount of "currency" I have.
- [ ] As a user, I can reload my game data.
- [ ] The game increases currency depending on an algorithm that calculates the rate.
### Stretch Goals
### Required
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
